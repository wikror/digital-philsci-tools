# Digital PhilSci Tools

An early & dirty release of various tools for doing digital philosophy of science. Geared towards using a local version of the S2ORC (Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus), maintained by Allen Institute for AI as part of their Semantic Scholar service (requires an API key). For S2ORC, please refer to the publication:

Lo, Kyle, Lucy Lu Wang, Mark Neumann, Rodney Kinney, and Dan S. Weld. 2020. ‘S2ORC: The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus’. arXiv:1911.02782. Preprint, arXiv, July 6. http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02782.

The tools are under continuous development, and the current version (December 2025) contains many quick and dirty solutions, including hard coding of parameters and paths, limited documentation etc. I am in the process of refactoring and improving the code, to enable wider and easier use.

The refactoring uses GitHub Copilot agent with Claude Sonnet 4.5 model, however the original code has been developed without the use of LLM agents.

This code has been developed for the purpose of my PhD dissertation titled "Scale-Free Communication? An investigation of the use of the concept "communication" in biology and cognitive sciences", prepared under the supervision of prof. Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi and prof. Marcin Miłkowski (as of December 2025: submitted, awaiting reviews & defense). Please refer to my website for more details ([https://wiktor.rorot.pl/projects/communication.html](https://wiktor.rorot.pl/projects/communication.html)). Data, figures, trained models, as well as a detailed workflow from the dissertation can be found on OSF: [https://osf.io/ax4jm](https://osf.io/ax4jm). The version of the code used for the analysis in the dissertation is secured as a release.

If you use the tools for your own research, I would appreciate a citation of the dissertation:

The development of these tools was funded by the National Science Center (Poland) as part of Preludium grant "Investigation of the use of the concept “communication” in biology and cognitive sciences" (2022/45/N/HS1/02434), awarded to Wiktor Rorot (supervisor: Marcin Miłkowski) (project begun in February 2023, planned conclusion: July 2026).
